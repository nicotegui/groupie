# ðŸ“‚ Groupie â€” Command-Line File Grouper with Missing File Management

> Organize your scattered files into logical, virtual groups without moving or copying them.  
> Easily track missing files with warnings and clean up your groups directly from the CLI.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Virtual File Grouping:** Create named groups of files tracked by absolute paths, without modifying the original files or directory structure.
- **Smart Group Management:** Files can only belong to one group at a time, with automatic handling when adding to a new group.
- **Missing File Detection:** When listing groups, any file paths that no longer exist on disk are flagged with a red asterisk (*), helping you quickly identify broken references.
- **Optional Auto-Cleanup on Listing:** Use the `--clean` (or `-c`) flag with the listing command to automatically remove missing files during display.
- **Dedicated Cleanup Command:** Run `gr clean` to scan all groups for missing files and remove them after an explicit user confirmation. Add the `-y` flag to skip confirmation and clean automatically.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works consistently on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Color-Coded Output:** Files are displayed with colors based on their type, similar to the Linux `ls` command.
- **Lightweight Storage:** Uses a simple JSON file stored at `~/.file_groups.json` to maintain your groups, making it easy to back up, edit, or migrate.
- **Intuitive CLI Interface:** Short commands and flags designed for speed and simplicity in terminal workflows.
